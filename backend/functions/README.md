# 📂 backend/functions

This folder contains backend or serverless functions that power parts of the application such as API endpoints, webhook handlers, and other custom logic.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

Use this directory to store individual function files that can be deployed as serverless functions (e.g., using Vercel, Netlify, or Supabase Edge Functions).

Each function should:

- Be self-contained
- Handle one specific task (e.g., send email, process form, respond to an API request)
- Use proper HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
